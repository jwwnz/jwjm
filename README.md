This project is a private repository creating a React JS based dynamic website for my wedding.

This website will:

1. Show information about my wedding.
2. Contain interactive links, maps and useful apps for non-korean guests.
3. Have an RSVP system, which populates guests details.
4. (optional) news about what me and Jimin are doing, similar to a blogging system.
5. (optional) login options for guests.
